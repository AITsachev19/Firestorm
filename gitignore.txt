.gitignore file for a general web project - Bare Minimum Git
.gitignore
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# .gitignore
# Bare Minimum Git
# https://salferrarello.com/starter-gitignore-file/
# ver 20210211
#
# From the root of your project run
# curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/salcode/10017553/raw/.gitignore
# to download this file
#
# This file is tailored for a general web project, it
# is NOT optimized for a WordPress project.  See
# https://github.com/AITsachev19/Firestorm.git
# for a WordPress specific .gitignore
#
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
# http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
#
# NOTES:
# The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not
# tracked by Git remain untracked.
#
# To ignore uncommitted changes in a file that is already tracked,
# use `git update-index --assume-unchanged`.
#
# To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked,
# use `git rm --cached`
#

Thanks for posting this as I was looking for exactly this gitignore file....switched from native java android coding to web and design and did not have an adequate gitignore setup for web projects

Please add a section for secrets (e.g. .pem, .key files etc)

@JohannesBe thanks for the feedback, this is a good idea

Off the top of my head it seems we should add the following

*.key
*.pem
*.der

This is great! I think adding .DS_Store in a misc category would be a good idea ðŸ˜„

Hi @YashTotale,

I believe

# ignore all files starting with . or ~
.*
should ignore .DS_Store. If you are seeing any different behavior let me know.

One note is that if you've added a file (e.g. .DS_Store) to your Git repo before you add this .gitignore, the file will not be ignored because it is already part of the repo.

Oh, I glossed over that section. Thanks!

Should we add .env to it too? Like I am new to .gitignore usage so I just had that doubt.

Yes, .env should be excluded. See Should I add .env to .gitignore?.

In this case, I'm ignoring all files that start with a period with a few exceptions (you can read more about this technique at .gitignore Hidden Files with Exceptions).

Reviewing this made me realize, I had not added .env.example to my list of allowed files that start with a period (.), so I've updated this .gitignore - thanks.
